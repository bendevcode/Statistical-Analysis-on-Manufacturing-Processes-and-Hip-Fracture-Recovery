# Statistical-Analysis-on-Manufacturing-Processes-and-Hip-Fracture-Recovery
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Statistical Analysis on Manufacturing Processes and Hip Fracture Recovery project.

## Question 1: Analysis of Manufacturing Processes
# Introduction
This analysis focuses on comparing the breaking strengths of fishing lines from two manufacturing processes: Process A and Process B. The aim is to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean breaking strength between the two processes.

# Data Description
The data includes the breaking strengths of fishing lines for Process A and Process B. The analysis reveals that Process B has a higher breaking strength than Process A. The mean and median breaking strengths, as well as the skewness and kurtosis, are provided for both processes. The data satisfies the assumptions of independence and constant variance.

# Analysis
A two-sample independent t-test is conducted to compare the means of the two processes. The assumptions of normality, constant variance, and independence are checked and confirmed. The t-test results indicate that there is no significant difference in the mean breaking strength between Process A and Process B.

## Question 2: Analysis of Hip Fracture Recovery
# Introduction
This analysis examines the walking speeds of individuals who have previously suffered hip fractures. The objective is to assess if the individuals have fully recovered based on their walking speeds.

# Data Description
The data includes the walking speeds of 20 individuals who have suffered hip fractures. The analysis reveals that the data is skewed to the right, indicating slower walking speeds. The minimum and maximum speeds, as well as the mean, median, skewness, and kurtosis, are provided. The data satisfies the assumption of normality.

# Analysis
A one-sample t-test is performed to compare the mean walking speed to the expected average speed of 1 meter per second. The assumption of normality is checked and confirmed. The t-test results indicate that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the individuals may have fully recovered.

Please note that the above summary is a brief overview of the analysis conducted for each question. The full analysis, including detailed methodology, calculations, and results, can be found in the corresponding analysis files within this repository.
